It is an IOS project that was done by our group for Mobile Computing Lab in the 6th semester.
Here, the daily activities can be shared with all the app users to find partners with common goals.
We used Swift language and Xcode to develop it. However, it is not wide wide-range developed project. We tried to implement our basic knowledge after learning basic Swift and Xcode.
