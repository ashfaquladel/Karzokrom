It is an IOS project which is done by our group for Mobile Computing Lab in 6th semester.
Here, the daily activities can be shared with all the app user to find partners with common goals.
We use swift language and Xcode to develop it. However, it is not wide range developed project. We try to implement our basic knowledge after learning basic swift and Xcode.
